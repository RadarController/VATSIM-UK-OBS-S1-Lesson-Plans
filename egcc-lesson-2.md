## Lesson 2 - Basic Aerodrome Control 2

- Environment: Sweatbox
- Duration: up to 90 minutes

## Introduction

This lesson focuses on common flightplan issues at Manchester, and how you will need to correct them prior to prodiving an aircraft with a clearance. If we have time, we'll also start to look at VFR movements.

Do you have access to the Manchester GMP/GMC moodle course? Course: [S1 | Manchester ADC | Delivery & Ground | VATSIM UK](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/course/view.php?id=34). This will be really helpful throughout your mentoring sessions.

- Manchester vMATS: [EGCC vMATS Part 2 - VATSIM UK Documentation](https://docs.vatsim.uk/Aerodrome/EGCC%20%28Manchester%29/0-vMATS/)

Which charts will you be using? Can you find them for me?

Today we’ll be completing Lesson 2, which covers the tasks of GMP and GMC at Manchester.

### Objectives

1. Navigate to the eAIP and discuss the different chart types and their features. 
2. Introduce basic altimetry – definitions of QNH and QFE and where they are used. 
3. Discuss the basic area of responsibilities of adjacent control positions (AIR, FIN, APP, TC and AC). What they do, how they appear in EuroScope, examples of when you might co-ordinate with them. 
4. Highlight any lateral and vertical flight plan restrictions specific to your aerodrome. 
5. Recognise errors in flight plans such as – initial routing for a SID, RFL for direction of flight, RFL for standing agreements. 
6. Explain and practise stand allocation using crib sheets and UKCP. 
7. Explain and practise using conditional clearances. 
8. Introduce VFR clearances for the circuit and CTR entry/exit. 
9. Consolidate objectives from previous lessons.   

### Lesson

1. Confirm that the latest sectorfile and UKCP are installed.
2. Do you have access to the UK eAIP? Always start at the AIP homepage [https://nats-uk.ead-it.com/cms-nats/opencms/en/Publications/AIP/](https://nats-uk.ead-it.com/cms-nats/opencms/en/Publications/AIP/) rather than an AIRAC specific link, then click "Online Version" under current AIP
