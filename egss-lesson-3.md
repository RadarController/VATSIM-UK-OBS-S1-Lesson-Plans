# Stansted

## Lesson 3 - Advanced Aerodrome Control

- Environment: Sweatbox
- Duration: up to 90 minutes

## Introduction

After your first two lessons, this one will be used to consolidate your knowledge on general aerodrome tasks such as checking and amending flightplans, providing clerances, push-back instructions, and taxi instructions. We will also start to look at non-standard procedures, introducting Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) today.

Do you have access to the S1 moodle course? Course: [S1 | Aerodrome Control | VATSIM UK](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/course/view.php?id=15). This contains the lesson plan that I’ll be following today, and that your future mentors will use as well.

Do you have access to the Stansted GMP/GMC moodle course? Course: [S1 | Stansted ADC | Delivery & Ground | VATSIM UK](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/enrol/index.php?id=56). This will be really helpful throughout your mentoring sessions.

Which charts will you be using? Can you find them for me?

Today we’ll be completing Lesson 1, which covers the tasks of GMP and GMC at Edinburgh.

### Objectives

1. Introduce low visibility procedures and talk through the local procedures associated with them.
2. Introduce METARs and TAFs and practise decoding simple examples.
3. Introduce non-standard IFR clearances (Airway departures, vectored departure) and practise issuing them.
4. Introduce use of the command line – aliases, private messaging, Function keys.
5. Consolidate objectives from previous lessons.

### Lesson

1. Confirm that the latest sectorfile and UKCP are installed.
2. Tell me about the roles of GMC, AIR, FIN and INT (ref [S1 ADC: Air Traffic Control Units: Types of ATC units | VATSIM UK](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/mod/lesson/view.php?id=454&pageid=844))
3. Tell me about some of the common flightplan issues at Stansted (level restrictions, SID restrictions, etc.)
4. Let's talk about weather for a while, can you find and decode the METAR for Stansted? [METAR EGSS - London Stansted Airport, London, United Kingdom])https://metar-taf.com/egss). Consider some with poor weather [badbadweather.com :: Worst weather reports worldwide](https://badbadweather.com/). Find a TAF and talk about how to decode it.
5. Low Visibility Procedures (ref [S1 ADC: Low Visibility Procedures](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/mod/lesson/view.php?id=720))
   - RVR or visibility decreases below **600m** (differs from UK standard of 550m), or a broken or overcast cloud ceiling forms below 200ft (ref [S1 STN: Taxi Routings and Holding Points](https://moodle.vatsim.uk/mod/lesson/view.php?id=1321&pageid=2255))
   - Aircraft cannot be assumed to see one another.
   - Conditional clearances, where a pilot is instructed to take an action after another aircraft has done something, cannot be issued
   - CATII/III holding points must be used to ensure the integrity of the instrument landing system (ILS) - on 22 they are S3 / R3 / Q3, on 04 they are H3 / K3 / L3 / G3/ W3
   - Fewer aircraft are allowed to move in a given time period
6. Non-standard departures to Luton, Heathrow, Gatwick
   - Delay absorption procedure (who to coordinate with)
   - Aircraft wishing to fly in the IFR circuit (with, without SID filed)
7. Text aliases and working with text-only aircraft
   - [Access the list of aliases](https://docs.vatsim.uk/General/Use%20of%20Software/Text%20Alias/)
   - Key ones `.v`, `.charts`, `.ratsn`, `.prenote`, `.srd`, `.fpl`
   - Private message using `.chat CALLSIGN`
   - `F1+1` to open SMR view, `F1+2` to open route checker
